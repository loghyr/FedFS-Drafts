Only reference local files (no http URLs) so that the documents can be
typeset without network access or when xml.resource.org is down.

For RFC XYZ, use this command to fetch its contents into this
directory:

 wget http://xml.resource.org/public/rfc/bibxml/reference.RFC.XYZ.xml

For other refences (I-Ds, academic publications, etc.), create 
the file by hand.
