<abstract>
<t>The Generic Security Service Application Program Interface (GSS-API), Version 2, as defined in, provides security services to callers in a generic fashion, supportable with a range of underlying mechanisms and technologies and hence allowing source-level portability of applications to different environments. This specification defines GSS-API services and primitives at a level independent of underlying mechanism and programming language environment, and is to be complemented by other, related specifications:</t>
<t>documents defining specific parameter bindings for particular language environments</t>
<t>documents defining token formats, protocols, and procedures to be implemented in order to realize GSS-API services atop particular security mechanisms</t>
<t>This memo obsoletesmaking specific, incremental changes in response to implementation experience and liaison requests. It is intended, therefore, that this memo or a successor version thereto will become the basis for subsequent progression of the GSS-API specification on the standards track.</t></abstract></front>
