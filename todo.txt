Tasks to complete draft-ietf-nfsv4-federated-fs-admin:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ADMIN-1
   Status: CLOSED

ADMIN-1.1
    Status: CLOSED
    Description: in 3, what does this following sentence mean? Please include a better
    explanation of the literal codes in the document.
    "Many of the error status names and meanings (and the prose for their descriptions)
     are taken from the specification for NFSv4 [3530bis]. Note, however, that the literal
     values for the status codes are different. "

ADMIN-1.2
    Status: CLOSED
    Description: FedFsNsdbName: "The port is the NSDB transport port." Different
    transport protocols might have different ports, so it might be important
    to identify the transport protocol, not just the port. There is also no
    discussion of the fact that LDAP is assumed.
    Plan: State that NSDB protocol must be LDAP and identify the transport

ADMIN-1.3
    Status: CLOSED
    Description: FedFsPath: there is an incomplete sentence in this description.

ADMIN-1.4
   Status: CLOSED
   Description: FEDFS_CREATE_JUNCTION: "If the fileset is read-only, then this operation
   SHOULD indicate this with a status of FEDFS_ERR_ROFS." why is this only a SHOULD?

ADMIN-1.5
    Status: CLOSED
    Description: lower case "may" and "must" - if these are RFC2119 keywords, please
    use capitals. If not, then please use different words top avoid any ambiguity.
    I suggest "might" for "may".

ADMIN-1.6
    Status: CLOSED
    Description: "Note that" is usually superfluous.

ADMIN-1.7
    Status: CLOSED
    Description: Security Considerations is too limited. At a minimum, the discussion
    about FEDFS_GET_LIMITED_NSDB_PARAMS should be referenced in the security considerations.
    Plan: Cite FEDFS_GET_LIMITED_NSDB_PARAMS in Security Considerations.

ADMIN-1.8
    Status: CLOSED
    Description: IESG often pushes for expanding acronyms on first use. Having the
    glossary at the end might cause problems. It would be wiser to move it forward (maybe
    put "requirements language" as section 1.1, and the glossary as section 1.2).
    Plan: Move glossary to the start of the document.

NSDB-1
    Status: CLOSED
    Description: Address transport area director (TSV-DIR) review comment from David Black

    "NFSv4 replica mechanism is not simple, especially in its full
    NFSv4.1 (RFC 5661) form - section 4.2.2.4 of this draft lists nearly 20 attributes
    that have to be specified in an LDAP entry in order to characterize a replica (a
    File Set Location in NFSv4 parlance). The details of how replica selection works
    are in RFC 5661, and require some careful reading to understand.  For replica
    selection and usage, Section 2.8.1 of this draft bothers me - despite being about
    consistency, it clearly states that replicas do not need to be read-write
    consistent, and that clients may switch among replicas transparently ... and this
    should all be ok because "it is the responsibility of administrators to guarantee
    the functional equivalence of the data" among replicas.

    That current text reminds me of the Forrest Gump quote: "Life was like a box of
    chocolates. You never know what you're gonna get."  Needless to say, "You never
    know what you're gonna get" is not a good network filesystem behavior, and the
    expectation is that administrators will configure the use of replicas to do
    considerably better than that.  Towards this end, I'd like to see some guidance
    to administrators in this draft for how to stay out of trouble; some of that
    guidance could be provided by reference to the longer explanation of the replica
    mechanism that's already in RFC 5661."
